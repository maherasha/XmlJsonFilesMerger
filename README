This Project was created as a task from the interviewing process for Freshcells.

- The aim of this application is to read set of xml and json files from a specified folder directory and consolidate these files into
one json file with a specific format.

- The Path to the folder directory can be set in the application.properties in the attribute (HOTEL_XML_FILES_DIRECTORY)
and the application will read only files of type xml or json and with the syntax (Numbers)-(coah or giata).(xml or json)

- The other attribute in the application,properties (JSON_OUT_FILE_PATH) is to set the file path location for the consolidated
json file, if the file exists it will be updated otherwise it will be created.

-to execute the application after updating the attributes in the properties file you can run the method
FreshcellsTaskApplication.consolidateHotelsData() and expects the output in the specified file
